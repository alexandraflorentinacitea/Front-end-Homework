                    <p>The 2017 Ford Mustang features an integral link independent rear suspension that helps minimize body roll and isolate road imperfections for a responsive ride and precise handling. Aluminum-alloy rear knuckles and H-arms help reduce unsprung mass. So Mustang has twice as much anti-squat and nearly 10 times the amount of anti-lift for better pitch control during hard acceleration and braking compared to the previous generation.</p>
